# 3D XYZRGB Reconstruction

This repository contains the description of a system that performs the extraction of geometric and color characteristics of a navigation environment, by using a reconstruction of a map with six dimensions of information: X, Y, Z, R, G and B.

## Software requirements

- Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
- ROS distribution: ROS Kinetic Kame [http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic)
- ROS nodes/drivers libraries:
	-   [Turtlebot](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_bringup?distro=kinetic)
	-  [Dynamixel servomotor](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel)
	-  [Hokuyo](http://wiki.ros.org/urg_node)
	-  [Camera](http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam)
- Python 3.6 in this case I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   OpenCV 4

## ROS Installing.

For ROS install you must follow the next steps:

-   [http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

or follow the video:

-   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36O6OGOJG1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36O6OGOJG1E)

## Use ROS

In a terminal you should run the ROS kernel with

`roscore`

in other tabs the following commands are executed, each in a separate terminal:

- `roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch`
- `roslaunch control_dynamixel_ax12 controller_manager.launch`
- `roslaunch control_dynamixel_ax12 start_motor_controller.launch`
- `roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam test.launch`
- `rosrun urg_node urg_node`
- `python send_command.py`

The proposed application contains two (2) modes of reconstruction.  The first one is called "`Scan and go`", is a continuous mode where the  robot  doesn’t  need  to  slow  down  during  its  trajectory. The  servomotor  on  which  the  LiDAR  sensor  is  supported operates  with  a  fixed  tilt  angle,  e.g.  with  a  45  degrees  of incidence in the central beam with respect to the floor.  Therefore the command is executed to position the servomotor at the required angle using the following python script:

`python mover_ax12.py`

Then the next python script is executed to start the reconstruction in "scan and go" mode.

`python scan_and_go_color.py` or `python scan_and_go_no_color.py`

This scan mode requires the pilot to move the robot manually in the directions that require rebuilding, therefore, the following command must be executed to tele-operate the robot.  

`roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch` or `roslaunch turtlebot_teleop ps3_teleop.launch`

When the path is finished, the environment map has been reconstructed, the text files are generated that save the X, Y, Z, R, G, B information of the environment map.  An example of the generated files is in the `data` folder. A 3D environment generated in this reconstruction mode is shown below.

The second mode of reconstruction is called "`Stop and scan`", this mode stops  the  robot  from  moving  at  some  points  wherethe pilot considers it, to perform scans with the servo motorin a range of inclinations from +45 degrees to -45 degrees, a common practice in fixed scanners.  This method has an effect on the point clouds that allows more information to  be  obtained,  especially  towards  a  higher  view,  howeverthe  scanning  times  will  be  longer  than  in  "Scan  and  Go" mode.

To start the reconstruction in this mode, the following python script is executed:

`python stop_and_scan_color.py` or `python stop_and_scan_no_color.py`

This scan mode requires the operator to move the robot manually in the directions that require rebuilding, therefore, the following command must be executed to tele-operate the robot.  

`roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch` or `roslaunch turtlebot_teleop ps3_teleop.launch`

At the points in the scenario where the reconstruction is required the pilot for the robot and sends a signal through a button generated by the python `send_command.py` script.  The robot starts the reconstruction and you must wait until the robot makes a sound, indicating that the reconstruction is finished and you must tele-operate the robot manually to the next point.  This operation is performed in the amount of points to be reconstructed from that environment.

When the path is finished, the environment map has been reconstructed, the text files are generated that save the X, Y, Z, R, G, B information of the environment map.  An example of the generated files is in the `data` folder. A 3D environment generated in this reconstruction mode is shown below.
